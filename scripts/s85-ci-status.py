"""S85: check the CI status of the operator's latest commit (50bf394, the
session_158.md transcript commit) — the CALIBRATED read (the lesson-118
doctrine: an anonymous-payload conclusion must be calibrated against
known-state controls before it enters the record).

Controls:
- known-green: run #177 (38875997857 on 5a6f80b, the s64 remediation push).
- known-RED: run #38948165037 on 7dd670f (the s65 closeout Install-dependencies
  flake — recorded FAILED in the worklog task 206; the known-red signature
  calibrates a live RED read the same way #177 calibrates a green one).

The s85 context: the operator's 50bf394 added docs/session_158.md (the s84
transcript) + a 359-file skills sync (verified byte-identical to the source
repo's own skills/ corpus — the recursive diff zero deltas) — the s84
agent's stream discipline HELD through its own log AND its mid-session
narration (session_157.md and the stream both carrying the safe forms), so
the operator's transcript carried no unsafe token: the local unit gate
read 296/296 at pull, and CI run #40033514826 on 50bf394 measured
COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY (the calibrated read, both controls first) — the
era's SIXTH green-at-pull (the streak restarting at s85: the s84 push
closed the tenth red window, the five-green streak s79-s83 having broken
at the s84 operator commit). Main is GREEN at pull and the s85 push must
KEEP it green (the s69-s83 form — NO red-main window exists to close).
The expectation must be VERIFIED against the page's real state, never
assumed (the s66 mid-run UNCLASSIFIED precedent: investigate before
concluding).
