Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Build production-ready clone of https://service-desk-332a5ae4.base44.app/ in /home/z/my-project/service-desk (cloned from github.com/nordeim/service-desk). Superset functionality + visual parity.

Work Log:
- Read pasted operating instructions (coding specialist agent standards)
- Cloned service-desk repo (scaffolding: package.json "orbital", src/lib/db-path.ts, tests, skills/, docs/) + scandihaven repo (reference: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md Tailwind v4 + Next 16 rules)
- Browsed reference site via agent-browser: logged in (sepnetflix2023@outlook.com), captured desktop+mobile screenshots to /home/z/my-project/reference-screens/
- Reference routes: /login, /dashboard, /submitticket, /mytickets, /ticketdetails?id=; auth = JWT localStorage (base44); statuses: open/in_progress/resolved/closed; priorities: low/medium/high/urgent; categories: hardware/software/network/access/email/other (emoji icons)
- Extracted exact DOM classes: sidebar (shadcn Sidebar, data-sidebar attrs, cyan-500→blue-600 gradient active items, white bg), ticket cards (rounded-xl, emoji in cyan-100→blue-100 gradient tile, amber-100 open badge, blue-100 medium badge), mobile header (md:hidden, backdrop-blur, SidebarTrigger), off-canvas sidebar with slide-in-from-left
- CSS vars: navy-950 #0a1628, navy-900 #0f2744, navy-800 #1a3a5c, cyan-500 #06b6d4, cyan-400 #22d3ee, amber-500 #f59e0b, emerald-500 #10b981
- Mobile menu verified working on reference (Radix overlay wrapper covers trigger at times — noted). Status/priority filter dropdowns verified. Comment flow verified.
- Read key skills: clone-app-pat-pro (computed styles = ground truth), tailwind-patterns (v4 CSS-first), nextjs16-tailwind4 (mobile nav failure taxonomy A-H), agents-md/readme-md/claude-md/PAD doc skills, ssh-git-wrapper skill
- Environment: no ssh binary; paramiko 5.0.0 installed via pip (shim approach for git push later)
- Existing infra kept: src/lib/db-path.ts + db.ts (resolves file:../db/custom.db → <repo>/db/custom.db), vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts (standalone server port 3100 + e2e.db + auth storageState pattern)

Stage Summary:
- PLAN: Next.js 16 App Router (real pages, no rewrites), React 19, TS strict, Tailwind v4 CSS-first @theme (literal hex, no var() chains — scandihaven rule), shadcn/ui (sidebar component for DOM parity), Prisma+SQLite (db/custom.db at repo root), HMAC cookie sessions (AUTH_SECRET) + scrypt password hashing + rate-limited auth, API route handlers, superset features: signup/forgot-password flows, working attachments, comments, search/filter/sort, health endpoint, resolution-time metric, toasts, skeletons, a11y
- REPLACES orbital scaffolding: next.config.ts rewrites (old /goals etc), old e2e specs (keep setup/global-setup/helpers pattern), project-management_SKILL.md; REGENERATES README/AGENTS/CLAUDE/PAD at the end
- Next: build schema+seed, deps, UI components, pages, APIs, tests, verify with agent-browser (esp. mobile menu + Tailwind v4 bugs), commit+push via ssh wrapper

Task ID: 2
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Build + verify ServiceDesk clone codebase (all gates), prepare for commit/push

Work Log:
- Built full app: Prisma schema (User/Ticket/Comment/Attachment), seed (4 users, 11 tickets), API routes (auth login/signup/logout/me/forgot-password, tickets CRUD + comments + attachments download, stats, health), pages (login/signup/forgotpassword + (app) route group: dashboard/submitticket/mytickets/ticketdetails with auth-guard layout), shadcn ui components (sidebar w/ Sheet mobile off-canvas, select, card, button, input, label, textarea, badge, sheet, skeleton, separator, tooltip, toast), AppSidebar + mobile header chrome
- Fixed DATABASE_URL contract: package.json scripts pin DATABASE_URL='file:../db/custom.db' inline (sandbox exports absolute DATABASE_URL env that overrides .env); db/custom.db at repo root; verified via /api/health
- Parity fixes applied (measured from live reference computed styles/DOM): sidebar bg #fafafa (not white), non-active nav text slate-600, footer user card (User icon avatar cyan-400→blue-500, gradient container from-slate-50 to-gray-50), Total badge bg-slate-600 rounded-md, dashboard restructure (max-w-7xl, gap-6, stacked full-width Performance [slate-50→white gradient card, trending-up header, clock tile] + Recent Tickets [white card], bottom centered View All Tickets CTA), stat card icons (users/circle-alert/clock/circle-check with exact gradients), page bg gradient from-slate-50 via-white to-blue-50/30
- Fixed REAL app bug: active nav text-white lost cascade to data-[active=true]:text-sidebar-accent-foreground (Tailwind v4 variant ordering) → text-white! important modifier (E2E-pinned)
- Fixed mobile sheet auto-close on nav link tap (setOpenMobile(false))
- Investigated "dark avatar" red herring: Next.js dev-mode nextjs-toast overlay (shadow DOM, bottom-left) polluting screenshots — disabled via devIndicators: false; production unaffected; gradient rendering verified bright via independent Playwright probe
- Fixed HTML nesting (p>div skeleton), useSyncExternalStore use-mobile hook (react-hooks/set-state-in-effect lint rule)
- Tests: 50 vitest unit tests (auth HMAC/scrypt/rate-limit, domain validation, utils, db-path) + 28 Playwright E2E (auth, dashboard, tickets lifecycle, mobile navigation incl. sheet open/close/overlay/escape/auto-close + desktop gradient parity) + smoke-test.sh (API surface) — ALL GREEN
- Verification gate: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ test ✓ (50) build ✓ e2e ✓ (28) smoke ✓
- Captured 7 verified screenshots → docs/screenshots/ (login, dashboard, submit, mytickets, detail, mobile dashboard, mobile menu open)
- Cleaned orbital scaffolding: removed project-management_SKILL.md, 13 orbital scripts, orbital next.config rewrites; rewrote smoke-test.sh for ServiceDesk; public/robots.txt added

Stage Summary:
- Production-ready superset of reference: adds signup, forgot-password, working attachments (2MB/3 files), owner status control, search/filter/sort/scope, comments, health endpoint, rate limiting, security headers, toasts, skeletons, a11y (focus trap, ARIA, keyboard)
- Next: commit + push via ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py + paramiko shim, then create AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/README.md/Project_Architecture_Document.md via repo skills, final push

---
Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Documentation phase + final push + final verification

Work Log:

- Created AGENTS.md (skills/agents-md): commands, invariants, verified-hard-way quirks (Tailwind v4 @theme inline + variant cascade + text-white!, async cookies/params, set-state-in-effect, Next dev-overlay false positive, role=alert ambiguity, rate-limit budget)
- Created CLAUDE.md (skills/claude-md): six-phase Meticulous Approach, parity-as-contract principle, implementation standards, anti-patterns
- Created Project_Architecture_Document.md (skills/project-architecture-document-md): 6 ADRs, layer model, annotated tree, 5 critical patterns, ER diagram, security architecture + threat model, test distribution (50 unit + 27 E2E specs + 1 setup = 28), known issues, key files
- .env.example de-orbitalized
- Pushed both commits via ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py + paramiko shim: 02d8fd8 (codebase) + cf8e4f0 (docs) — remote verified == local HEAD both times
- Operator key shredded per skill protocol
- Final gate: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 50 unit ✓ smoke ✓ dev server healthy ✓ browser check (dashboard renders, gradient + white text live, no errors)

Stage Summary:
- COMPLETE: production-ready ServiceDesk clone pushed to git@github.com:nordeim/service-desk.git (main @ cf8e4f0)
- Deliverables: full codebase (48 TS files), 7 screenshots in docs/screenshots/, 4 regenerated root docs, all gates green

Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Session 2 — remediation execution, verification, docs, SKILL.md, commit + push

Work Log:
- Fixed tickets.spec defects: non-retrying count() → toHaveCount (A1); getByText toast-announcer ambiguity → { exact: true } (A2)
- Wrote 18-test visual-parity.spec.ts (red) pinning all reference-measured contracts; went green after implementation
- Implemented all 9 remediation groups: C1/C2 sidebar (gradient quick stats + border-t footer + w-4 icon), B1/B2/B3 chrome (app-wide gradient wrapper, flex-1 overflow-auto scroll container, non-sticky mobile header with plain h1, text-4xl page headings), D1-D5 dashboard (bg-card shadow-lg cards, flat divide-y RecentTicketRow, p-6 border-b header, <p> perf value, outline CTA), E1 mytickets (max-w-7xl, mb-8 header, 3-col filter grid, pl-10 search), F1-F5 detail (grid lg:grid-cols-3, gradient card header with inline badges incl. "priority" word, avatar comments + ml-10, text-xs uppercase labels, button-style back), G1/G2 submit (shadow-2xl card, gradient header, p-8 body, back button), H1-H4 login + signup + forgotpassword (max-w-md shell, backdrop-blur, slate top bar, ring-4 in-card logo from public/logo.png — fetched from reference app, bg-slate-50/50 inputs, bg-slate-900 sign-in, OR divider)
- Housekeeping: removed empty untracked src/app route dirs, deleted lint-violating scratch script
- Gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 50 unit ✓ build ✓ 46/46 E2E ✓ smoke 10/10 ✓
- Live re-verification vs reference: quick stats geometry IDENTICAL (48px rows, 16px offset, 14px labels); mobile header IDENTICAL (static, 20px h1, 0 brand tiles); detail gradient header computed style confirmed; refuted 3 false VLM claims (active-nav color, quick-stats style, missing gradient header)
- Refreshed docs/screenshots/ (7 shots); updated README/AGENTS/CLAUDE/PAD for the remediated codebase; .env.example verified matching (already tracked)
- Created service-desk_SKILL.md (599 lines, 20 sections + 2 appendices) via skills/distill-codebase-skill + skills/to-distill-project-into-skill patterns; versions verified from node_modules

Stage Summary:

Task: Session 3 — refresh repo, review session_2 docs, audit recent changes, fresh gap analysis vs live reference, remediation plan

Work Log:
- git pull: 70ecc59 adds docs/session_2.md (session-2 retrospective) + prompt-to-review-2 delta
- Reviewed AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PAD/service-desk_SKILL + docs/session_2.md + docs/remediation-plan-session2.md + worklog — all aligned with the codebase (env, db path, skills/ exclusion in all 4 configs re-verified)
- Baseline gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 50 unit ✓ build ✓ 46 E2E ✓ smoke 10/10 ✓ (working tree clean at 70ecc59)
- Audit of session-2 commit f89730f (code-review-checklist + verification-and-review-protocol skills): source clean; confirmed open known issues (no CI, no prefers-reduced-motion) + vitest.config.ts orbital comment drift
- Fresh gap analysis vs live reference (agent-browser, two sessions): DOM dumps for all 5 pages both sites; entrance-animation parameters measured via a Playwright MutationObserver probe (opacity 0→1 + translateY(20px)→0, spring ~310 ms with ~12% overshoot, NO stagger; motion wrappers per page counted)
- 12 parity gaps found (recent-row structure incl. FileText tile + arrow + no category badge + date-only dates, lowercase badges, entrance animations, submit-form details, login caption, search icon w-5, info-panel tracking-wide, transparent <main>); 8 VLM screenshot claims checked against computed styles — 5 refuted (icon-only sidebar, no nav gradient, tinted tiles, wrong category value, external-link icon)
- Mobile navigation verified on BOTH sites: reference opens/stays-open-on-tap (our auto-close is the superset); clone opens, overlay-close, Escape-close, auto-close, icons + labels present, zero console errors
- Wrote + validated docs/remediation-plan-session3.md (12 gaps + known-issue closure + intentional divergences)

Stage Summary:
- Repo at 70ecc59 + plan. 12 gaps + 2 known issues (CI, reduced-motion) + 1 latent hydration bug identified and planned.

Task ID: 7
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Session 3 — remediation execution (TDD), verification, docs, SKILL.md v2.1.0, commit + push

Work Log:
- TDD: 3 formatDate unit tests + 11 red session-3 parity tests + 1 clean-hydration E2E pin written first
- Fixed the latent hydration bug found during live verification: the performance-value <p> held the Skeleton <div> (invalid p>div) → inline span skeleton; pinned by dashboard.spec "hydrates cleanly"; all pages now load with ZERO console errors
- Implemented all 12 gaps: RecentTicketRow rework (FileText icon tile, title/arrow wrapper, no category badge, formatDate date-only); badges lowercase (capitalize removed); entrance animations via globals.css @keyframes + @utility animate-rise-in (cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) 0.3s backwards) + motion-reduce:animate-none + global prefers-reduced-motion block; submit form (CircleAlert header icon, blue priority SelectValue, emoji-span category value, reference dropzone w/ Upload icon + label-for, inline pt-4 footer no border-t, Send icon); login/signup/forgotpassword caption removed; mytickets search icon w-5; detail labels tracking-wide; SidebarInset → flex-1 flex flex-col (transparent)
- Known issues closed: .github/workflows/ci.yml (verify + e2e jobs); vitest.config.ts comment de-orbitalized
- Hardened 2 latent-flaky raw evaluate(getComputedStyle) assertions → auto-retrying toHaveCSS (mobile-navigation + dashboard specs)
- Gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 53 unit ✓ build ✓ 57/57 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓
- Live re-verification: every fixed contract confirmed via computed styles/DOM on the dev server (animation-name rise-in 0.3s, FileText w-6 cyan-600, lowercase badges, date-only dates, blue priority, transparent main); mobile menu re-verified; final VLM composite check on dashboard + submit: IDENTICAL
- Refreshed docs/screenshots/ (7 shots); updated README/AGENTS/CLAUDE/PAD/service-desk_SKILL.md (v2.1.0); .env.example verified unchanged-matching

Stage Summary:
- All 12 session-3 findings + hydration bug fixed and E2E-pinned; 57 E2E + 53 unit + smoke green; CI added; parity verified against the live reference
- Deliverables: remediated codebase (14 source files + 2 test files + ci.yml + globals.css), docs/remediation-plan-session3.md, refreshed screenshots, 5 updated docs

Task: Session 4 — refresh repo, review session_3 docs, audit recent changes, fresh gap analysis vs live reference, remediation plan

Work Log:
- git pull: c02276c adds docs/session_3.md (session-3 retrospective)
- Baseline gates at c02276c: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 53 unit ✓ build ✓ 57/57 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓
- Audit of session-3 commit 6d7d21b (code-review-checklist + verification-and-review-protocol skills): source clean; the suspected ci.yml trigger corruption (`branches: ain]`) was a DISPLAY ARTIFACT — the Bash tool output renderer eats `[m` sequences (byte-level proof via bracket substitution + PyYAML); CI file is correct
- Fresh gap analysis vs live reference (agent-browser, 2 sessions): DOM dumps for all 5 pages + sidebar + login + the reference's 404 both sites; live geometry probes; 9 VLM composite claims checked — 5 refuted (stat-card tints, CTA colors, input width, login card/logo/labels, filter-bar replacement)
- HEADLINE FINDING: sidebar nav layout wrong since session 1 — the reference wraps icon+label in an inner `div.flex.items-center.gap-3`; without it our `justify-between` pushed labels 132px right AND `[&>svg]:size-4` shrank icons to 16px (ref: 12px gap, 20px icons, 600-weight labels). Verified by geometry + VLM on BOTH sites; missed by 3 sessions of screenshot composites
- 16 findings total (nav structure ×3, badges shadow/compact-padding ×3, submit labels/grid/cyan-focus controls ×3, ghost back buttons, rounded-lg mobile trigger, Google-logo wrapper, tracking-wider revert, designed 404 page) + 3 reference-site defects deliberately NOT copied (toast viewport blocks their mobile trigger; /signup + /forgotpassword dead-ends) + display-name divergence documented (account name vs email local-part — the reference has no name concept)
- Mobile navigation verified on BOTH sites: reference trigger partially BLOCKED by its own toast viewport (elementFromPoint proof); clone trigger fully clickable (Radix region pointer-events:none), sheet opens, overlay/Escape close, nav-tap navigates + auto-closes, zero console errors
- Wrote + validated docs/remediation-plan-session4.md (16 gaps + ledgers + risks)

Stage Summary:
- Repo at c02276c + plan. 16 gaps (1 HIGH: the nav wrapper), 2 reference defects to avoid, 1 divergence documented.

Task: Session 4 — remediation execution (TDD), verification, docs, SKILL.md v2.2.0, commit + push

Work Log:
- TDD: 16 red session-4 parity tests written first (all verified red against the pre-fix build); the session-3 tracking assertion flipped wide→wider (reference re-measured)
- Implemented all 16: nav items wrapped in the reference's inner `flex items-center gap-3` div (fixes label position + 20px icons in one change) + `font-semibold` labels + active-item hover gradient (`hover:text-cyan-700!` needed vs `text-white!`); badge atoms gained `shadow hover:bg-primary/80` + a `compact` padding prop (px-2.5 py-0.5 on dashboard rows + detail priority); submit form (labels `text-slate-700 font-semibold` with ONE-text-node plain asterisks, `md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`, cyan-focus + shadow-sm controls, bg-transparent selects); ghost back buttons both pages; mobile trigger `rounded-lg hover:bg-slate-100 p-2`; Google-logo `-ml-4` wrapper; info labels tracking-wider (revert); NEW src/app/not-found.tsx replicating the reference's designed 404 (text-7xl font-light 404 + divider + Page Not Found + path-aware message + Go Home)
- Fixed 1 test-authoring defect: the mobile-trigger negative regex matched the unrelated `dark:hover:bg-accent/50` — lookbehind `(?<!dark:)` added
- Gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 53 unit ✓ build ✓ 73/73 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓
- Live re-verification: nav geometry IDENTICAL to reference on desktop AND mobile sheet (icon 20px, gap 12px, label weight 600, wrapper flex gap-3, justify-between no-op); badge computed shadow + 2px/10px compact padding; submit label weight 600 + "Issue Title *"; back button border 0px; input shadow + slate-300 border; grid 2-col/24px gap; 404 renders with all contracts; zero console errors on every page
- Refreshed docs/screenshots/ (7 shots); final side-by-side composites rebuilt — VLM confirms the nav layout now matches (residual color claim refuted: identical from-cyan-500 to-blue-600 on both, E2E-pinned)
- Updated README/AGENTS (session-4 contracts section)/CLAUDE/PAD (known-issues row + test distribution)/service-desk_SKILL.md (v2.2.0 + lessons 11-15)

Stage Summary:
- All 16 session-4 findings fixed and E2E-pinned; 73 E2E + 53 unit + smoke green; parity re-verified live against the reference
- Deliverables: 7 source files + 2 new files (not-found.tsx, remediation-plan-session4.md) + spec updates + refreshed screenshots + 5 updated docs
- Ready for commit + push via ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py

Task: Session 5 — refresh repo, review session_4 docs, audit recent changes, fresh gap analysis vs live reference, remediation plan

Work Log:
- git pull: 9c3f446 adds docs/session_4.md (session-4 retrospective, pushed by the repo owner)
- Reviewed AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PAD/SKILL v2.2.0 + session_4.md + remediation-plan-session4.md + worklog — all aligned with the codebase (env, db path, .env.example, skills/ exclusion re-verified)
- Baseline gates at 9c3f446: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 53 unit ✓ build ✓ 73/73 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓; audit of session-4 commit c0a5a39 clean (all changes match the plan)
- Fresh gap analysis vs live reference (agent-browser, both sites): DOM dumps for all 5 pages + sidebar + 404 both sites; paired live measurements; 11 VLM composite claims checked — 8 refuted (stat tiles, form indentation, dropzone, login spacing/inputs/links, footer icons, page bg); mobile navigation verified on BOTH sites (reference trigger still blocked by its own toast viewport — elementFromPoint proof; clone trigger fully clickable, sheet geometry 20px/12px/600, overlay + Escape close, nav-tap auto-close, zero console errors)
- OPERATOR-ERROR LESSON: the DOM-dump helper derived its target origin from location.origin while the browser was on the REFERENCE — "clone login" attempts were silently executed against the reference (its base44 API answered Security verification required). The clone was never broken; the helper now takes an explicit origin + asserts it
- Wrote + validated docs/remediation-plan-session5.md: 8 findings (icon-button 12px padding via has-[>svg]:px-3; v3→v4 shadow-scale naming trap across 11 controls; next/font Inter vs the reference's webfont-free system stack; missing mr-2 on back/comment icons; CTA 2px slide; quick-stat hover:bg-primary/80; 404 focus ring) + 2 false gaps caught by computed re-measure (outline shadow; submit-icon nav-item misidentification)

Stage Summary:
- Repo at 9c3f446 + plan. 8 gaps (2 HIGH: icon-button padding, font family), 2 false gaps reverted with evidence, 8 VLM claims refuted.

Work Log:
- TDD: 17 red session-5 parity tests written first (8 core + 3 shadow-trap + 2 typography + 4 icon contracts; all verified red, incl. 1 authored-wrong test caught by the computed re-measure and fixed)
- Implemented G1: quick-stat badges + hover:bg-primary/80; G2: Button size variants stripped of has-[>svg]:px-* (icon buttons 12px→16px, back buttons 189px→197px); G3′: 11 shadow-sm→shadow-xs flips (form controls, submit buttons, mobile header, Google hover, Card base) + session-4 E2E class-pins flipped; G4: 404 Go Home focus ring + duration-200; G5: Inter next/font removed, --font-sans pinned to the reference's computed system stack in @theme inline, antialiased dropped; G6: mr-2 on back arrows ×2 + Add Comment svg; G7: CTA arrow translate-x-1; G8 REVERTED (probe had matched the sidebar NAV item "Submit Ticket" — the reference's real form button is Send w-4 h-4 mr-2; session-3 pin restored)
- Gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 53 unit ✓ build ✓ 90/90 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓
- Live re-verification (paired, both sites): back buttons 197px = 197px; submit buttons 160px = 160px (send w-4 h-4 mr-2 both); all fixed controls' computed shadows = rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 2px 0px; body font ui-sans-serif stack + smoothing auto on both; zero console errors on every page; mobile menu re-tested (trigger BUTTON at hit point, 20px/12px/600, overlay close via real pointer events, nav-tap auto-close)
- Refreshed docs/screenshots/ (7 shots); final VLM dashboard composite: IDENTICAL
- Updated README/AGENTS (session-5 contracts section + reference)/CLAUDE (font rule)/PAD (test distribution + known-issues row)/service-desk_SKILL.md v2.3.0 (lessons 16-18)

Stage Summary:
- All 8 session-5 findings fixed and E2E-pinned (90 E2E total: +17 parity tests); 2 false gaps caught and reverted by the verification protocol; parity re-verified live against the reference (paired measurements)
- Deliverables: 11 source files + 3 test/spec updates + remediation-plan-session5.md + refreshed screenshots + 5 updated docs

- Fresh gap analysis vs live reference (agent-browser, explicit-origin dump helper scripts/s6-dump.sh, paired computed probes, both sites): all 5 pages + mobile + dropdown-open + FOCUS states — three never-probed surfaces: the RADIUS SCALE, focus-visible interaction states, select dropdown open states
- 9 findings: the radius-scale trap (shadcn v4 calc chain renders rounded-sm/md/lg/xl at 6/8/10/14px vs the reference's v3 defaults 2/6/8/12px — +2px app-wide, identical class names); the focus-state matrix (3px translucent-cyan new-gen rings vs solid 1px near-black; --ring was cyan; auth inputs wrong generation + at-rest shadow); the double-emoji category-trigger bug (🖥️🖥️ Hardware Issue — no pin ever exercised a selection); select dropdown contracts (emoji-span options, per-priority colors, trigger follows selection); split signup line; Google button at-rest shadow
- Wrote + validated docs/remediation-plan-session6.md (9 gaps + per-surface focus matrix + non-gaps ledger + risks)

Stage Summary:

- Implemented: G4 radius tokens pinned to v3 literals in @theme inline (sm 2px / md 6px / lg 8px / xl 12px); G5+G5b focus tails swapped on Button/Input/Textarea (focus-visible:ring-1 ring-ring) + SelectTrigger (plain focus:ring-1) + --ring #06b6d4→#0a0a0a + auth inputs' older generation (ring-2 slate-400 + ring-offset-2 + ring-offset-white + shadow-none) + base transitions to transition-colors; G1 whole-line signup links (login + signup) with inner font-medium span; G2 Google shadow-none; G3+G6 emoji-free labels + emoji-span structure on options + trigger; G7+G8 PRIORITY_SELECT_CLASS map on options + trigger; session-4 cyan-focus pins superseded per computed evidence (text inputs drop the inert customs; selects + textarea border keep the active ones)
- Test-authoring fixes during red→green: lab() color representations accepted (v4 emits palette colors as lab()); transition-colors races one-shot evaluates → auto-retrying toHaveCSS/expect.poll; Tab-loop checks activeElement itself (BODY textContent contains the page); select test uses .focus() (our Radix moves focus into the open dropdown); auth.spec signup-link name updated to the whole-line accessible name
- Gates: lint ✓ typecheck ✓ 54 unit ✓ build ✓ 107/107 E2E ✓ smoke 11/11 ✓
- Live re-verification (paired, both sites): radius table identical (12/6/6/8/2px); focus matrix identical (1px near-black rings, 2px slate-400 + white offset on auth, cyan select ring); category trigger single emoji + gap-2 option structure; priority colors + High→orange trigger; Google no at-rest shadow; whole-line signup link; mobile menu re-tested (trigger hit-tests to BUTTON at 8px radius, 20px/12px/600 sheet, overlay + Escape close, nav-tap auto-close, zero console errors)
- VLM composite sweep (7 composites): login/ticket-detail/mobile-dashboard IDENTICAL; dashboard + mobile-menu claims = the documented "/"-no-highlight divergence (re-verified the reference DOES highlight at /mytickets) + data; submit + mytickets claims refuted by DOM (trigger texts + placeholder identical; stat tiles 48px = 48px)
- Refreshed docs/screenshots/ (7 shots); updated README/AGENTS (session-6 contracts)/CLAUDE (radius + focus rules)/PAD (distribution + known-issues row + token table)/service-desk_SKILL.md v2.4.0 (lessons 19-22); session_6.md retrospective appended; this worklog

Stage Summary:
- All 9 session-6 findings fixed and E2E-pinned (107 E2E total: +17 parity tests, 61→78); production-ready superset maintained; ready for commit + push via ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py
